step 1: extraLarge array trail, on the insert function is nearly 40 times as length to run as the append function (1.983375ms and 774.939 ms)
results for append
tinyAppend 5.667 μs
smallAppend 4.625 μs
medAppend 28.791 μs
largeAppend 110.458 μs
xLargeAppend 1.423708 ms

results for insert
tinyInsert 3.041 μs
smallInsert 7.375 μs
mediumInsert 103.375 μs
largeInsert 6.158417 ms
xlargeInsert 771.234125 ms


the append function starts off with less run time until it reaches the small array.
the unshift button while it has similar results has to rename the index in said array each time, which is going to be significantly longer depending on the length of the array (n)
so its run time grows expotentially longer along with the array.
